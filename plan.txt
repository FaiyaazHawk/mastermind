figure out how to display disks

6 colors to display: green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan, grey

hint pins   red pin for correct color in correct place
            white pin for correct color in wrong place
            no pin if neither match

hint_peg = "\u29bf"
peg = "\u25cf"

board template for 1 guess

Guess 1 | O O O O | Hint: W _ R _

Figure out how to draw colored circles in the terminal


Setting up computer ability to guess.
# going hunting for pegs. will only work since hints are positionally locked. take 6 guesses with each color and for white pegs,
# lock them to the guess.
